# juxtaposeAlpha-template
This is the alpha of my team's custom Wordpress theme. After the alpha is complete, this repo will contain the initial front-end template (what the theme
will be based off of) and the wp-content files required for the theme itself. The idea behind this project is to provide a clean, organized, and easily
accessible template for local news sites.
